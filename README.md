# LanesDetectionAlgorithm
This is a demo project on how computer vision works and can detect objects, lanes or anything using some trained datasets. The main objective of this project is to write an algorithm to detect lines using computer vision package in python. I used OpenCv, numpy and matplotlib libraries in python for this project.
